# Pixelmon Legendary Alarm
This script can be set up for a Pixelmon Server running locally to make a noise when a legendary pokemon spawns.
This is an R script, which can be run by itself or by using the batch file to start it in an R terminal window.

To use the script the first time, you will need to:
	Modify "Pixelmon Legendary Alarm.R" Line 15 to have the path to server logs

If using the batch file to run in an R terminal window:
	Modify "Pixelmon Legendary Alarm.bat" Line 2 to have the path to "Pixelmon Legendary Alarm.site"
	Modify "Pixelmon Legendary Alarm.bat" Line 3 to have the path to "R.exe"
	Modify "Pixelmon Legendary Alarm.site" Line 3 to have the path to "Pixelmon Legendary Alarm.R"

Optional:
	Modify "Pixelmon Legendary Alarm.R" Line 39 as commented to be the path to an audio file
