# Pixelmon 9.1.0 Lid Fixer
Pixelmon 9.1.0 has a bug where ball recipes got updated, but lid recipes did not. This makes the lids and balls incompatible. This script creates a datapack to fix the lid recipes.

To use the script the first time, you will need to:
	Rename the Pixelmon mod .jar file to end in .zip (change file type)
	Extract Pixelmon .zip to a folder
	Modify "Pixelmon 9.1.0 Lid Fixer.py" Line 9 to have the path to the "./data/pixelmon" folder (in your extracted pixelmon folder)
	Modify "Pixelmon 9.1.0 Lid Fixer.py" Line 10 to have the path to the "./world/datapacks" folder (in your world save folder)
